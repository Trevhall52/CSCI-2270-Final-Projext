All compilation is to be done by simply running the "Driver.cpp" file. Simply run the file, and follow-up commands will be prompted for in the program.

In the case of the examples in my report, the commands used after running the program are:

1. 1
2. Aerification
3. n

1. 2
2. Hematinometric
3. n
